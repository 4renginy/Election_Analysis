We are helping Colarado Board of Elections employee Tom, in an election audit of the tabulated results for the US Congrational Precint in Colorado. Historically the audits have been done in excell, however Colarado Board of Elections wants to automate the process. If it is done successfully the process could be used not only in other districts but also for other elections. <br>

The tasks we are asked to complete are:

    *Total number of votes cast
    *A complete list of candidates who received votes
    *Total number of votes each candidate received
    *Percentage of votes each candidate won
    *The winner of the election based on popular
    


# Process and Tools
